__Queuing Ships__
IF mouseOver shipButtons AND shipsInQueue < 5
        add ship to queue (or add the type to queue?) (It just needs to know what type of ship it is creating next)
        Begin deploying
        IF deploymentComplete
                create ship (whatever is first in queue)
                remove from queue


shipButtons still need to be draggable while queue < 5

IF after training is complete queue is not empty
        call ship creation method again until queue is empty


IF mouseBtnPressed on shipButton AND not dragging
        set ship selected index
        set colour of selected ship button
        set dragging to true


IF shipIsTraining && shipDroppedOnToLane
        queue that next ship



IF shipBuilderButton selected
        set shipButtonSelectedIndex


IF shipBuilderButton released AND spaceLaneSelected
        set spaceLaneSelectedIndex
        begin starship deployment process
                IF shipAssemblyInProgress
                        queue ship




ONLY when the shipAssemblyBar is FINISHED are the queues popped. Meaning, queue.front() won't be updated until AFTER the pop methods are called.

WHILE the StartNextShipDeployment() method is being ran the FIRST time, AND player queues another ship, its simply queued but happens (for now)

WHEN SpawnShipFromShipyard_OnStarshipDeploymentComplete() is called after training of the first ship is complete, the queues are popped and the shipAssemblyBar reset. Then StartNextShipDeployment() is called again (if queue size > 0, which it is in this case).

NOW, this method SHOULD run correctly because the front of the queues have been updated since they were just popped. However, the shipAssemblyBar does not reappear and the queued ship(s) don't begin training for some reason.

==============USEFUL INFORMATION===============
============================================
- Background image is 4096x4096
- Window dimensions are 1280x720

- Minimap view is larger than it appears, as the background simply
  isn't large enough to accommodate the entirety of the viewport.

- Change background texture rect size

- The minimap view doesn't appear to be actually moving when the main viewport moves?
  They should move in sync with each other. Do I need to set its position constantly to
  that of the main viewport?

- Currently the background image for the level is WAY TOO LARGE. However, it looks good.

- Dimensions of background need to change. Should be wider in width.

============================================
================ENEMY SPAWNING===============
============================================
- Spawn a random enemy type every x amount of seconds
- Stronger enemies have less chance of spawning
- Spawn specific enemy types based on various conditions
- Create a Director Ai system that defines spawning rules
- Conditions:
   - If enemy in lane was spawned x amount of time ago, spawn enemy in lane
   - If player has x amount of specific unit types, spawn enemy type
