=================PSEUDOCODE==================
============================================

BUG:
If a starship begins engaging an enemy but another starship
comes up behind it (not already following) then it will overlap it?

NOTE:
HUD elements
- Player Mothership text, healthbar, and scrap amount
- Enemy Mothership text, healthbar, and scrap amount

TODO:
- Create a class that encapsulates the above elements? (MothershipStatusDisplay?)

============================================
==============USEFUL INFORMATION===============
============================================
- Background image is 4096x4096
- Window dimensions are 1280x720

- Minimap view is larger than it appears, as the background simply
  isn't large enough to accommodate the entirety of the viewport.

- Change background texture rect size

- The minimap view doesn't appear to be actually moving when the main viewport moves?
  They should move in sync with each other. Do I need to set its position constantly to
  that of the main viewport?

- Currently the background image for the level is WAY TOO LARGE. However, it looks good.

- Dimensions of background need to change. Should be wider in width.
