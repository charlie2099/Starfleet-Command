- Background image is 4096x4096
- Window dimensions are 1280x720

- Minimap view is larger than it appears, as the background simply
  isn't large enough to accommodate the entirety of the viewport.

- Change background texture rect size

- The minimap view doesn't appear to be actually moving when the main viewport moves?
  They should move in sync with each other. Do I need to set its position constantly to
  that of the main viewport?

- Currently the background image for the level is WAY TOO LARGE. However, it looks good.

- Dimensions of background need to change. Should be wider in width.


__THOUGHTS__
- Should the spacelanes be in constant motion  in front of the player flagship?
  - NO,
- OR
- Should the spacelanes be stationary in the level, and have the player
  flagship move in the centre lane?
  - NO, because the flagship doesn't fit in the lanes
     - HOWEVER, the enemy flagship needs to fit in the lane regardless!
  - NO, because the flagship should be attackable from any lane? When
     an enemy ship reaches the end of its lane, it automatically attacks
     the mothership either through shooting or exploding?


__Enemy Spawning__
- Spawn a random enemy type every x amount of seconds
- Stronger enemies have less chance of spawning
- Spawn specific enemy types based on various conditions
- Create a Director Ai system that defines spawning rules
- Conditions:
   - If enemy in lane was spawned x amount of time ago, spawn enemy in lane
   - If player has x amount of specific unit types, spawn enemy type
