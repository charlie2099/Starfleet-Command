___Perk & Upgrades System___

HOW IT WORKS
- When the player achieves enough XP (from destroying starships),
the game is auto-paused and the player is provided with a choice of
THREE perk and/or upgrade cards. After selecting a card, the game
shall resume, with the perk/upgrade now in effect. This process
repeats when the player meets/exceeds another XP threshold.

EXAMPLE UPGRADE CARDS
- Dreadnought_UpgradeCard

EXAMPLE PERK CARDS
- IncreasedScrapCollectionOnStarshipDestruction_PerkCard
- ReducedStarshipCosts_PerkCard
- ScrapBoost_PerkCard (i.e. displays a card named Scrap Booster,
with a PERK label top right, with a short description of the perk and
it's effects like +25 scrap every collection)

___ENEMY AI- BEHAVIOUR___
- Start of the game, deploy a random selection of weak units, to taunt
the player/get the battle going. (i.e. RandomUnitSpawnStartofGame_BehaviourRule(UNITS, SPAWN TIME) )
- Spontanously spawn random enemy units through the game, in
random intervals of 30-90 seconds, picking stronger units when the
 enemy exceeds certain scrap thresholds (RandomUnitSpawnIntervals_BehaviourRule(UNITS, SPAWN INTERVALS) )
- Counter the players attacks/strategies, prioritising the most
dangerous threats first (CounterAttack_BehaviourRule(THREAT UNIT, COUNTER UNITS) ).
- Spawn random units in undefended/unguarded lanes (UnguardedLaneAttack_BehaviourRule) )
- Spawn more or fewer units depending on how much scrap the
 player has (PlayerScrapLow_BehaviourRule(), PlayerScrapHigh_BehaviourRule() )





__AI DIRECTOR BEHAVIOUR RULES__
Build-up - MaxEnemyPop(10), MaxLightFighters(4), etc,
Peak - MaxEnemyPop(20), etc
PeakFade - MaxEnemyPop(5), etc
Respite - MaxEnemyPop(0), etc

Build-up - Max enemy population, restricted starship type spawns, default director calculation speed
Peak - Sustain max enemy population, unrestricted starship type spawns, special events?, enhanced director calculation speed (director at it's most analytic, and reactive state. Faster decision-making abilities.)
PeakFade - Minimum enemy population
Respite - Redundant state, remove entirely?

CounterAttack_BehaviourRule(DirectorState::BUILD_UP, ...)
CounterAttack_BehaviourRule(DirectorState::PEAK, ...)





___AI DIRECTOR___
- BUILD-UP (default spawn rate, default spawn chance of starship types, default lane spawn chance)
- PEAK (increased spawn rate, increased spawn chance of stronger starship types, increased chance of better lane spawning)

director.SpawnEnemy_OnDeploymentCompleted(TYPE, LANE)
director.SetEnemySpawnFrequency()

When to trigger behaviour calculator events
- Every time the director changes state (i.e. build-up, peak, etc)
- Every x amount of seconds?
- When a behaviour rule condition is met? (subscribe to a behaviour calculator callback that is invoked when a rule condition is satisfied?)
- Based on priority? first in first out?
- Based on intensity?


What do I want?
- Start of the game, spawn some weaker starships. Do this for a bit? or just once? While intensity below a certain threshold?
- If the player starts doing really well, spawn some stronger units, utilise different strategies
- If the player starts really struggled, spawn some weaker units or halt on spawning any more units until intensity reaches a certain threshold?


__Ai Logic__
- Spawn units that counter the player's units
- Overwhelm the player with loads of units during PEAK phase only
- Prioritise specific starship types
- Prioritise player-focused lanes


__Behaviour Rules__ (Name rules according to their actions, rather than their conditions? I.e. SomeAction instead of PlayerSpacelaneDominance?)
- CounterAttack
- FlankManeuver
- TankStrategy
- DamageStrategy
- StrongInitialAttack
- AttackMothership
- AllOutAttack
- AllOutDefence
- Reinforcement(DirectorState::PEAK)
- LaneRotation
- LaneConcentratedAttack
- DiversionAttack
- PriorityTarget

__Intensity Rules__ (Name rules according to their conditions, rather than their actions?)
- ScrapAbundance(scrapSurplusAmount, intensityRating)
- SpacelaneDominance
- StarshipDominance
- StarshipTypeDominance
- MothershipDistress
-

___Game Flow___
- Early game: Start with deploying weaker enemy units
- Mid game: After the player has deployed x amount of ships or of a certain type, the director should start deploying counter attacks, deploying stronger units
- Late game: Ai becomes even more aggressive, deploying stronger units and focusing on specific lanes

==============USEFUL INFORMATION===============
============================================
- Background image is 4096x4096
- Window dimensions are 1280x720

- Minimap view is larger than it appears, as the background simply
  isn't large enough to accommodate the entirety of the viewport.

- Change background texture rect size

- The minimap view doesn't appear to be actually moving when the main viewport moves?
  They should move in sync with each other. Do I need to set its position constantly to
  that of the main viewport?

- Currently the background image for the level is WAY TOO LARGE. However, it looks good.

- Dimensions of background need to change. Should be wider in width.

Combat Rules
- Lightfighters have low range, medium attack rate, low damage, and low health
- Heavyfighters have low range, high attack rate, low damage, and low health
- SupportFrigate have low range, low heal rate, low heal, and low health
- Dreadnoughts have high range, low attack rate, high damage, and medium health
- Battleships have medium range, low attack rate, medium damage, and high health
