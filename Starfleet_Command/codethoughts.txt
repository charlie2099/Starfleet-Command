- Background image is 4096x4096
- Window dimensions are 1280x720

- Minimap view is larger than it appears, as the background simply
  isn't large enough to accommodate the entirety of the viewport.

- Change background texture rect size

- The minimap view doesn't appear to be actually moving when the main viewport moves?
  They should move in sync with each other. Do I need to set its position constantly to
  that of the main viewport?

- Currently the background image for the level is WAY TOO LARGE. However, it looks good.

- Dimensions of background need to change. Should be wider in width.
