## Overview
A 2D top-down tower defence strategy game, developed with C++ and the SFML library.

## Concept
Taking inspiration from the classic games Age of War and Plants Vs Zombies, Starfleet Command pits the player against an AI opponent in an intense battle for supremacy. The goal is simple: defend your mothership at all costs while battling to destroy your enemy's mothership. Battles unfold across five lanes, in which the player must strategically deploy starships, manage resources, and make tactical decisions in real-time to defeat their adaptive, AI director-controlled opponent. The player is periodically rewarded with selecting a randomly generated perk and/or upgrade which, coupled with the AI director, keeps the game interesting and fresh on every play.

### Key Features
- Lane-based combat
- Adaptive Ai opponents through the use of an Ai Director
- Roguelike perk & upgrades system

## Compilation
- In the Cmakelists.txt ensure to set the SFML_DIR path to wherever your SFML directory is located. 
- MinGW 7.3.0 compiler version required.
