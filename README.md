# Starfleet-Command

## General
A 2D top-down strategy game blending elements of real-time strategy with tower defense. Developed with C++ and the SFML library.

## Concept
Taking inspiration from the classic games Age of War and Plants Vs Zombies, Starfleet Command pits the player against an AI opponent in an intense battle for supremacy. The goal is simple: defend your capital ship at all costs while battling to destroy your enemy's capital ship. Battles unfold across five lanes, in which the player must strategically deploy starships, manage resources, and make tactical decisions in real-time to defeat their adaptive, AI director-controlled opponent. The player is periodically rewarded with selecting a randomly generated perk and/or upgrade which keeps the game interesting and fresh on every play.
